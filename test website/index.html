                <p>
                    This website is a summer project i started at the end of my third year in Computer Engineering. The idea behind it was to make my own website that shows my programming
                    portfolio that i wouldnt have to pay for. This website uses html, css, and javascript to function and is completely coded by myself.
                    Currently, this website is running on my raspberry pi 4 that i have programmed for hosting websites acting as a server. Along with some port forwarding with my
                    router and the use of a site known as noip to create a free domain.
